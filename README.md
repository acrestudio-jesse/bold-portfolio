Personal Portfolio Created in React:

Front End Dependencies:
React Router Dom
Framer Motion
React

Initialized: 8/6/2022

UPDATE: 8/22/2022

Finally figured out how to add an email service. This one is just a connection from EmailJS, but eventually I will build my own server.

I still haven't bitten the bullet to change my image loader to be lazy or "in-view" because it is much more complicated than I remembered. Soon, I'll try again with more realistic expectations.

One thing I did do was to make it (relatively) responsive for mobile use. Hopefully, I can work out the kinks with that in the future.

Finally, in trying to build a shop, I realized that I likely have to use something like Hydrogen to integrate Shopify, so I will begin research into that kind of implimentation.

UPDATE: 8/17/2022

Styles and Static JSON files have been written and updated. Most styles and animations are functioning reasonably, though more customization will likely make them look cooler.

TODO:

1. Learn to integrate Shopify Hydrogen FW
2. Adjust Portfolio renders to "in-view" 

FINISHED:

X Routes
X Page Render Animations
X JSON Static Data
X Public Image Folder
X Rig and Implement Email responses on Contact page.
X Make responsive for my phone.
